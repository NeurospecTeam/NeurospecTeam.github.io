Dr. Amadio was educated at Princeton University, where he received an honors
degree in Physics/Biophysics, followed by Harvard Medical School and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his M.D. degree through
the physician-scientist curriculum at the Division of Health Sciences and
Technology (HST). He completed postdoctoral residency training in neurosurgery
at the Emory University School of Medicine, where he served as Chief Resident.

Alongside his neurosurgical career, Dr. Amadio has developed deep expertise in
the development and commercialization of medical device technology. In 2010 he
earned an M.B.A. with Distinction at Harvard Business School, focusing on
medical device innovation, regulatory approval, and entrepreneurship. In 2014 he
co-founded the startup incubator NeuroLaunch, which led to the formation of 12
companies in the neurotechnology space. In 2019, he became the Program Director
for the Ascension-Dell Innovation Fellowship, which seeks to align physicians,
engineers, and entrepreneurs to spin out new medical technologies from the UT
Austin ecosystem. He is an active angel investor in technology startups and sits
on several advisory boards. He also holds a part-time staff role at a
venture-backed medical device company that is deploying $363 million in funding
toward brain-computer interface technology.
